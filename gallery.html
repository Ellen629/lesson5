        <p id="m">Justin Timberlake is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actor who gained worldwide popularity
            in the late 1990s as a member of NSYNC, one of the best-selling boy bands in history. He later became one of
            the most prominent and commercially successful pop stars of the new millennium after releasing his solo
            albums during the group’s hiatus. After attaining this pop peak, Timberlake followed up on other ventures,
            including film acting and entrepreneurship.

            Born “Justin Randall Timberlake” in Memphis, Tennessee in 1981, his father worked as a Baptist church choir
            director in Shelby Forest. Timberlake started singing at a young age. He cites Janet Jackson as his major
            musical influence.</p>
